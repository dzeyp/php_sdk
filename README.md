/**
 * Upload receipt to AI server to be processed
 *
 * @param $file array|string|object
 * array - single HTTP File Upload variable ($_FILES) (for array of files see upload_multiple method)
 * string - file path (used for fopen function)
 * object - a Laravel request file object (https://laravel.com/docs/5.6/requests#files)
 *

 */
$file = 'receipt.jpg'; //direct grab from directory
$file2 = $_FILES['receipt']; //from upload form

$upload_response = $api->upload($file); //or $file2

//receipt token is generated from API after successful upload, else will receive error
$receipt_token = $upload_response['token'];

/**
